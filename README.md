# üß† Deepfake-Detection-Model-using-CNN-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for detecting deepfake videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a focus on the EfficientNetB0 architecture. The system leverages face detection, data augmentation, and transfer learning to accurately classify video frames as real or fake.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [FaceForensics++ (FF++)](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)
- **Structure**: Real and fake video folders with `.mp4` files.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Frame extraction every 30 frames.
  - Face detection using Haar Cascades.
  - Cropping, resizing (224x224), and normalization.
  - Data augmentation applied to fake frames (e.g., rotation).
